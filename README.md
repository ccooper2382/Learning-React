# Learning-React

Going through the Code with Mosh react tutorials

1/30/2022 Learned how to work with the 'children' prop as well as how to raise and handle events

12/27/21 Began learning about JSX and components.  <React.Fragment> and <React.Strictmode> will behave as a parent element even though they are not rendered
